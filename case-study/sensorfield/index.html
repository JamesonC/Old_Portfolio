          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb4 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">A pumper is in charge of a x amount of oil and gas wells each day. A pumper’s route may take up to several driving hours every day to visit each one of these wells. They are responsible to make sure everything is working correctly, take oil tank gauges of production on a piece of paper, resolve any problems or spills, and then move on to the next. So the guys are essentially blind to what is happening across their fields until they are on-site. This is where remote monitoring benefits your operations.</p>

  <p class="ma0 mb4 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">Remote monitoring provides a 24 hour insight into what is going on across your fields. This leads to earlier detection of issues responsible for production delays, safety and environmental concerns and added expense. The norm for the past few decades have been SCADA systems. Only the mid tier and top tier companies have been able to justify the high costs of these systems. You have to lay wire, pour concrete, and have that company come out to install and configure everything.</p>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">Sensorfield was founded in 2011, by Strode Pennebaker, a third-generation engineer and fourth-generation oilman. The company makes advanced remote oilfield monitoring solutions for wells that previously couldn’t justify any remote monitoring technology.</p>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">He wanted a simple, practical system to keep up with wells he operated himself. Something he could install and maintain himself with minimum bother.</p>

  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">He wanted a simple, practical system to keep up with wells he operated himself. Something he could install and maintain himself with minimum bother.</p>
</div>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">So he started with a basic goal: create a sensor the size of a refrigerator magnet, stick it onto a tank or pipe or anything else, and watch data show up on a desktop and cellphone display. This was a radical idea at the time - now it’s called the Internet of Things. And we’re the first to bring it to the oil patch.</p>
</div>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">They began by studying all of the commercial off-the-shelf sensors, radios and SCADA gear we could find. They quickly realized that they needed to redesign the entire system from the ground floor - otherwise they weren’t going to make the gear any more affordable than the next guy. And this certainly wouldn’t address the heart of the oil patch: the stripper well population.</p>
</div>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb1 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">So they started over and decided to custom-design and manufacture everything. They had the first system working in less than three months. But it took four more years to perfect the size, ruggedness and quality. Along the way we discovered a groundbreaking new RF technology and became the first company to write fully optimized software for it. They created new sensor designs and found novel ways to imbed high-resolution micro-sensors into rugged oilfield equipment. Then they optimized everything to run on micro-power from tiny solar panels less than 1–½ inches across.</p>
</div>

          <div class="mw45 center ph1 ph2-m ph0-l">
  <p class="ma0 mb4 merriweather f1_125 fw3 dark-gray lh2">Sensorfield flips the negatives associated with these SCADA systems, cost, installation, and size, turning them into positives. Below are the sensors the company has invented from the chip level up.</p>

Simply place a wirelesss sensor on a tank, beam pump, compressor or other equipment you want to monitor. Super strong magnets will hold it in place. Push a button, and the sensor connects to your secure website and begins monitoring. The cost of the devices is drastically less than SCADA competitors installation fees alone.</p>

We started using Sensorfield technology in our Kansas wells and, to date this year, haven’t had one environmental issue that wasn’t caught before it had a major effect. The investment has already paid out in spill prevention alone, not to mention the ongoing cost savings and improvements we’ve made based on Sensorfield’s high resolution data,” said Sensorfield customer Mark Bieker, operations manager at Trek AEC. “As cliché as it sounds, Sensorfield’s digital monitoring solution is a game-changer for our company.”</p>

I’ve learned a lot from having Strode as a mentor to date and will apply this unique knowledge throughout my career.</p>
